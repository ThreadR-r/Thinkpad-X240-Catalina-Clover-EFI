# Thinkpad X240 Catalina Clover EFI
Before going further, please take with a grain of salt! Use this EFI with your own risk, I am not responsible for any damage that may occurs.
While this EFI is working on my thinkpad x240 with mac os catalina, it does not mean will work on your laptop.

## Versions:
I create 2 branch to hold different version of clover bootloader.
- main branch (It's Clover-r5119), you can download directly from https://github.com/nalakawula/Thinkpad-X240-Catalina-Clover-EFI/releases/tag/release-202011262032
- clover-5127, you can download directly from https://github.com/nalakawula/Thinkpad-X240-Catalina-Clover-EFI/releases/tag/release-202011262035

Choose which one do you want to use. The different is the clover's version. Clover r5127 use quirks, clover 5119 is not use quirks.
